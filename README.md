# IntecaTask 
### Microservices app created with SpringBoot and Docker.


## Requirements to run the application

  - Java 11
  - Docker 3+
  
  Unfortunately I didn't know how to create maven script for running all docker containers.
  Anyway for running docker containers you should:
  1. Pull repository
  2. In parent directory run: 
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
